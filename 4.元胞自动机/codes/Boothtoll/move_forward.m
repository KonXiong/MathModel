function [plaza, v, time] = move_forward(plaza, v, time, vmax, srvrate)
% 
% move_forward   car move forward governed by NS algorithm:
%
% 1. Acceleration. If the vehicle can speed up without hitting the speed
% limit vmax it will add one to its velocity, vn -> vn + 1. Otherwise, the 
% vehicle has constant speed, vn -> vn .
%
% 2. Collision prevention. If the distance between the vehicle and the car 
% ahead of it, dn , is less than or equal to vn , i.e. the nth vehicle will
% collide if it doesnâ€™t slow down, then vn -> dn - 1.
%
% 3. Random slowing. Vehicles often slow for non-traffic reasons (cell 
% phones, coffee mugs, even laptops) and drivers occasionally make 
% irrational choices. With some probability pbrake , vn -> vn - 1, 
% presuming vn > 0.
%
% 4. Vehicle movement. The vehicles are deterministically moved by their 
% velocities, xn -> xn + vn.

% USAGE: [plaza, v, time] = move_forward(plaza, v, time, vmax)
%        plaza = plaza matrix
%                1 = car, 0 = empty, -1 = forbid, -3 = empty&booth
%        v     = velocity matrix
%        time  = time matrix, to trace the time that the car cost to pass 
%               the plaza.
%        vmax  = max speed of car
%        srvrate = Service rate
